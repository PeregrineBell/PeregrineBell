- Hi, Iâ€™m Peregrine.
- I'm an Autistic/ADHD individual who recently developed a strong interest in cybersecurity. The field of cybersecurity provides an ideal blend of structured, logical thinking combined with novelty and a sense of purpose that keeps me feeling motivated and challenged. 
- I'm currently following the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate on Coursera, and am working on building a portfolio. My skillset is growing and currently includes security audits, incident reports, Linux, and SQL. By the end of the course I'll be able to identify and mitigate risks, threats and vulnerabilities, protect networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorised access and cyberattacks using Security Information and Event Management tools, and use Python, SQL, and Linux for cybersecurity. 

- I'm currently looking for entry-level remote/hybrid work in the cybersecurity field. I live in Lincolnshire, UK and am willing to travel as needed. 

- Reach me at peregrinebell16@outlook.com or send a message  to 07706 667505. I look forwards to hearing from you.
